# Pcap Exporter

A Prometheus metrics exporter for captured TCP data. Additionally, it can also
perform live packet capture.

# Installing dependencies

The appropriate pcap library needs to be installed (e.g. libpcap-dev for Debian).
For that, follow the `Installing dependecies` section of: https://github.com/rust-pcap/pcap.

# Development

## Prek for pre-commit

Install prek on your development machine:
```
cargo install --locked prek
```
Or use one of the methods listed here: https://github.com/j178/prek.

Add it to your git hooks:
```
prek install
```

Now, it will be run before every commmit. If you wish to run prek manually,
you can do `prek run`.
